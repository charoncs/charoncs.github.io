  <p>I am a graduated Computer Science student with a strong interest in both technology and design. With a background in programming, graphic design, and video editing, I enjoy creating practical, visually appealing solutions that connect with people. I’m known for my ability to work well under pressure and handle challenging situations calmly and professionally. I thrive in team environments, communicate effectively with people from diverse backgrounds, and take pride in delivering work that meets high standards, even within tight deadlines. Driven, adaptable, and creative, I’m always eager to learn new skills and tackle new challenges.</p>
